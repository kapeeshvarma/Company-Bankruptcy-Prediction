# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction
## A Supervised Classification project on the Prediction of Company Bankruptcy.

The Prediction of Bankruptcy in companies is a problem that has concerned entrepreneurs, researchers and even governments for years, since detecting early signs that a company is going to enter bankruptcy involuntarily and being able to save it from that process, can help reduce the economic losses that bankruptcy entails, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.

In this project, we analyze the data collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy has been defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Various financial rates and ratios are analyzed and different classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVC, RandomForestClassifier etc; have been used to predict bankruptcies with very high accuracy.
